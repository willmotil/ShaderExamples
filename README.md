# ShaderExamples  

These are shader examples for the MonoGame Framework ... https://www.monogame.net/ 
These examples were tested against a DirectX project.
 Each game1 folder here is nearly stand alone, It has a shader that goes with it and some images.


To run the one you want to look at, from the project itself.
Edit the program.cs

Comment in the game1_xxx example you want to see execute and comment out the others.
